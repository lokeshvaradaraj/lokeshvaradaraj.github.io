I am **Lokesh**, a **B.Tech student in Engineering Physics at IIT Delhi**, passionate about **Machine Learning for Physics Research**. My work lies at the intersection of **theoretical physics, computational methods, and artificial intelligence**, with a focus on data-driven scientific discovery.

## About Me
I am currently in my **6th semester**, actively involved in multiple research projects that explore the synergy between **machine learning and physics**. My primary areas of interest include:
- **Particle Physics & ML:** Developing models to distinguish signals from background noise in high-energy physics datasets.
- **Cosmology & ML:** Using symbolic regression techniques to model halo mass functions from large-scale simulations.
- **Statistical Physics & ML:** Applying theoretical insights from physics to improve machine learning models.

## Research & Projects
Some of my recent and ongoing projects:
- **Halo Mass Function Modeling** (CNRS, Paris & IAP Paris): Using symbolic regression to extract meaningful relationships from cosmological simulations.
- **Particle Physics Classification** (IIT Delhi): Applying ML techniques such as decision trees and neural networks to separate tau signals from QCD backgrounds.
- **Statistical Physics for ML** (IIT Delhi, ELV832): Exploring statistical mechanics methods to analyze neural networks and generalization.

## Academic Goals
I am committed to pushing the boundaries of **machine learning in physics**, with a long-term vision of contributing to **data-intensive science**. My next steps include refining my expertise in **advanced ML techniques**, **probabilistic modeling**, and **high-performance computing** for large-scale scientific applications.
